        <p>• Exercising and feeling better</p>
        <p>We’ve all experienced the sheer exhaustion that comes after strenuous activity – free weights, rowing machines, cardio machines, and such can really take it out of you.<br> But if you have done any hard exercise, you will also be familiar with
            the afterglow – that strange relaxed ‘feel good’ experience you get as your body starts to recover.<br> We now know that it’s due to chemicals being released in the body that help it to relax. It’s like your body’s reward system for helping
            it become healthier.
